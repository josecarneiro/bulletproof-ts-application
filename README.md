# Building a bullet proof applications with TS

In this presentation we'll showcase some strategies to build applications that never fail.

We want to achieve **0 Runtime Errors**.

For that, we're going to follow the mantra:

"Make Impossible State Impossible"

We'll use exhaustive type-checking to prevent unhandled scenarios, and parse all data we receive without making assumptions or asserting types.

The current status of the project is the final solution we want to present. I'll deconstruct it on a separate branch so that we can then work on it until it reaches this state.
